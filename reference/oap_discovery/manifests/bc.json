Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%), and exponentiation (^). Use scale=N to set decimal precision. Includes math library functions with -l flag: sine (s), cosine (c), natural log (l), exponential (e), arctangent (a), and square root (sqrt). Use for precise arithmetic, unit conversions, or any calculation that needs more than floating-point precision.",
