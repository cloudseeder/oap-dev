  "description": "Schedules a command to run once at a specified future time. Takes a time specification (e.g. 'now + 5 minutes', '4:00 PM', 'midnight', 'noon tomorrow', '2pm Jan 15') and reads commands from stdin. The commands execute in a copy of the current environment. Use atq to list pending jobs and atrm to remove them. Unlike cron, at is for one-time deferred execution, not recurring schedules. Common use: schedule a reminder, delay a backup until off-peak hours, or queue a deployment for a maintenance window.",
