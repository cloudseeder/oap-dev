# OAP Tool Bridge Credentials
# Copy to credentials.yaml and fill in your API keys.
# credentials.yaml is gitignored — never commit real keys.
#
# Keys are matched by manifest domain. The auth type (api_key, bearer)
# and header name (auth_name) come from the manifest's invoke spec.

# Example: API key auth (manifest has auth: "api_key", auth_name: "X-API-Key")
# mynewscast.org:
#   key: "your-api-key-here"

# Example: Bearer token auth (manifest has auth: "bearer")
# api.example.com:
#   key: "your-bearer-token-here"
